# Group Programming Timer

A GUI application intended to act as a timer when carrying out group programming, which provides very direct and
obvious notifications when the timer is up and the developer's turn is over. The idea for this is that it helps ensure
that everyone in the group gets their turn typing and that developer's do not overrun their turn.

This has been created because the standard timers on OS X did not provide visible enough feedback when the timer has
ended, and to provide the opportunity to try some Java GUI development.

The application is written in Java 8 and uses JavaFX for the GUI framework.
